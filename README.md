#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
To interpret user needs and implement them into a program, it is important to first understand the user's goals and requirements. User stories are a great way to capture and document these requirements. User stories describe specific user interactions with the software and include information about what the user wants to achieve, why they want to achieve it, and what they need to do to achieve it. Creating user stories helps to ensure that the program is built with the user's needs in mind. 

#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When approaching program development, it is important to have a clear understanding of the problem you are trying to solve and the user needs you are trying to address. Once you have a clear understanding of the problem and user needs, you can begin to break down the development process into smaller tasks and focus on delivering value to the user as quickly as possible. Agile processes are a great way to approach program development because they focus on delivering value to the user in an iterative and incremental manner.

Some of the agile processes that you can incorporate into your future development work include:
Kanban, this visual framework is effective for managing and completing work. Kanban involves using a board to track tasks and their progress. Tasks are moved from one column to the next as they are completed.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) because this set of practices involves continuously testing, integrating, and delivering code changes to a production environment. CI/CD helps to ensure that code changes are high-quality and can be delivered to users quickly and efficiently.

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Good team members are able to communicate their ideas clearly and effectively, and they actively listen to their teammates.
Software development projects are typically complex and multifaceted, so good team members are able to work collaboratively with others to achieve shared goals. 
Good team members in software development have strong technical skills and are able to contribute to the project in meaningful ways.
